#ou only need to specify the location of the log files inside the FileBeat container, which in our case is /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log.
# Its goal is to enrich the docker logs with useful information, such as the name of the image or the name of the container
#It allows to parse logs encoded in JSON.
#settings concern FileBeat own logs.
